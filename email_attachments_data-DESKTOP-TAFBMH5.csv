Unfortunately, we have not received the product back, and there is no clear instruction on how to retrieve it. We called your customer service, but it took over 10 minutes to connect. When we finally spoke to a representative and expressed the difficulty in reaching support for such urgent matters, we were advised to use the live chat option. However, this feature has been unavailable for the past month, despite being very helpful before.

 Compliance Mistakes","Hi Happy Haat,





Are You Hiring Fairly? Avoid These 5 Compliance Mistakes
Protect Your Company and Build a Stronger Employer Brand



Hiring the right talent is important—but hiring the right way is critical. Non-compliance in recruitment not only risks legal penalties but can also damage your company's reputation.








1. Unclear Job Descriptions
Ensure every posting includes clear, non-discriminatory requirements.




 




2. Biased Screening Processes
Use structured interviews and objective assessments to avoid unconscious bias.




 




3. Improper Record Keeping
Maintain accurate documentation for all hiring decisions.




 




4. Ignoring Equal Opportunity Laws
Stay updated on labor laws and anti-discrimination policies.




 




5. Inconsistent Candidate Communication
Treat all candidates with fairness and transparency throughout the process.








By making your hiring process compliant, you not only protect your organization but also build a stronger employer brand that attracts top talent.

You’re not alone. A lot of our users get stuck this way at first.
 
But the good news is, setting up your number is a one time process.
 
And once you’re done, you can start sending bulk messages, automate replies and support, and connect WhatsApp to your website or tools to trigger automated notifications in no time.

 Chances","Hi Happy Haat,





Avoid These 5 Interview Mistakes & Boost Your Chances 🚀
Don't Let Small Mistakes Cost You the Job



Landing an interview means you're already halfway there. But even the most qualified candidates can miss out on great opportunities because of avoidable mistakes.








1. Not researching the company
Employers notice when you haven't done your homework.




 




2. Arriving late
First impressions matter; always be on time.




 




3. Overtalking or rambling
Keep answers clear, structured, and focused.




 




4. Speaking negatively about past employers
Stay professional and positive.




 




5. Forgetting to ask questions
Show your interest and engagement by asking smart questions.








👉 Remember: A well-prepared candidate stands out from the crowd. Avoid these mistakes, and you'll increase your chances of landing your dream job.
